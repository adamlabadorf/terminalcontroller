============

This small script provides convenience functions for formatting text written to 
bash and tcsh terminals.  It was modified from code found at:

  http://code.activestate.com/recipes/475116/

The only significant additions are convenience functions for colorizing output,
printing different levels of info (announce, info, warn, and error), and properly
handling text wrapping when color-coding characters are printed in user input
prompts.  Useful for, e.g. printing out info/status to the terminal screen during
interactive scripts.
